Bisquick has been my Po Po's secret ingredient all these years. Say what you will about boxed mixes, but after fifty years of using Bisquick, it has become essential to the soft texture of her fa gao. Back in Hong Kong Po Po used a self-rising flour that's made specifically for fa gao. It turns out that self-rising flour and Bisquick have vitrually the same ingredients: all-purpose flour, baking powder, and salt. Only the addition of hydrogenated vegetable shortening in Bisquick sets them apart.
